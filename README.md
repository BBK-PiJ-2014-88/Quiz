A Quiz System using RMI

Although the coursework specification said there was no need to create a sophisticated GUI, i have created a GUI using Swing as 
i thought it was a good opportunity to learn about GUI's.

The Quiz can be launched by running the ServerLauncher.java class in the Quiz.src.server package to set up the server
Once the server has been set up, Clients can be launched by running the ClientLauncher.java class in the Quiz.src.client package

The Quiz System allows for concurrent requests to the server. Multiple SetUpClients and PlayerClients can be launched from the ClientLauncher and operate at the same time without producing unusual behaviour.
